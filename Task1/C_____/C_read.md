TASK 1(C) - Decipher the array sequence in four queries
           
            This is an interactive problem. 

            Adit and Advay decide to play a game. The game is described as follows: Advay considers a
            sequence of 6 distinct numbers from the following {10,8,7,16,9,43}, not necessarily in the same
            order. Adit’s job is to guess the exact order of these 6 numbers. Adit can ask Advay some queries of
            the form ---> x y, for which Advay gives the answer of a[x]*a[y]. Advay is very clever and limits
            the number of queries that can be asked to four. Formally, Adit can ask atmost 4 queries. Adit wants
            to write a program that gives the exact order of the sequence considering the answers he receives
            from Advay. Formally, the program should give the output for whatever answers Advay gives for
            Adit’s queries(Advay’s answers are always a product of 2 numbers (taken from the above sequence)
            ) .Adit is very busy with his intern. He turns to you for help. Please help him.
